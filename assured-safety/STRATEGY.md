## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles
1. **Premium positioning** - Above LELO ($100-$1,690 range)
2. **Clean tier structure** - $100/$100/$200/$200 jumps
3. **69 easter egg** - All prices end in .69 (subtle brand humor)
4. **Founding savings 15-21%** - Exclusive, not desperate
5. **Fixed dollar savings** - Feels like a gift, not a clearance sale

### Why NOT 30% Off
- Hermès doesn't do 30% off
- Louis Vuitton doesn't do 30% off
- Rolex RAISES prices
- 30% signals liquidation, not luxury

## WEBSITE UX STRATEGY

### Luxury Retail Psychology
- **Lighting:** Soft, warm tones (not clinical white)
- **Layout:** Spacious, minimal clutter, generous whitespace
- **Flow:** Guided journey, not overwhelming product grid
- **Imagery:** Lifestyle context, not just product shots
- **Copy:** Sophisticated, educational, never crude

### "Buyer Spends More" Methodology
- Slow the browse (encourage exploration)
- Sensory language (describe materials, weight, texture)
- Curation over catalog (limited, curated selection)
- Subtle social proof (not screaming testimonials)
- Exclusivity cues ("Limited edition," "Artisan crafted")

### Navigation Structure
- Collections (not "Products")
- Materials focus (Glass Collection, Precious Metals)
- Experience-based categories (Solo Exploration, Couples Discovery)
- Education hub (guides, material science, care instructions)
